									<h3>Avocados? Why?</h3>
									<div class="row">
									<p class="7u">Avocados are green, pear-shaped fruit loaded with important nutrients.
										A single serving of avocado contains <strong>over 10%</strong> of your recommended daily
										allowance of Vitamins B5, B6, C, E as well as <strong>over 20%</strong> of your recommended
										daily allowance of Folate, and Vitmain K. Thats in addition to the
										Magnesium, Manganese, Copper, Iron, Zinc, Phosphorous, Vitamin A, B1, B2, and B3
										that they contain. Wow!<br><br>
										Don't forget Potassium, most Americans do. An average adult only gets half of their
										recommended daily allowance of Potassium.
										[<a href="http://www.fasebj.org/content/27/1_Supplement/621.7">Source</a>]
										<strong>Avocados are loaded with potassium,</strong> containing 140% more than a banana. You don't miss out on any
										important nutrients when you eat avocados, especially fresh ones from Avocado Emporium. Delivered to your
										door just days after they're picked off the tree and ensured for the <strong>utmost quality</strong>, our avocados contain
										more nutrients than any plain old avocado from a grocery store.
